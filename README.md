## Relationship to AIRadio

This repository is an **optional plugin for AIRadio Core**.

AIRadio handles:
- Script generation
- Text-to-speech
- Audio creation

This plugin handles:
- Video footage preparation
- Script-based music video generation

Each component can be used independently,  
but together they form a complete AI media pipeline.

---

## Use Cases

- AI-generated music videos
- Narrated lyric videos
- Message-driven short videos
- Shareable AI audio content for social platforms

---

## Philosophy

This project is part of the AIRadio ecosystem.

Instead of a single monolithic tool,  
AIRadio is built as a set of small, composable plugins.

Each plugin:
- Has a clear responsibility
- Can evolve independently
- Gains more value when combined with others
